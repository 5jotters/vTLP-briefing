# vTLP-briefing
Wellcome to the virtual Tactical Leadership Program pages hosted by the spanish squadron [GV5JS](http://foro.gv5js.com/). Virtual TLP offers to the participants the oportunity to fly composite attack force missions in DCSW. The exercise provides an scenario where the virtual pilot is exposed to the complexities of planning, briefing and executing a  COMAO.

The main objective is to mimic the real TLP that takes place in Albacete, Spain, to the extend that it is possible inside a simulation. In short, the vTLP aims for training and development of knowledge and leadership skills, necessary to conduct a multirol air tactical mission.

The programme has been hosted by the GV5Js since 2018 using Falcon BMS. After three successful editions, the vTLP staff has decided to also offer the course in DCSW. In this simulator headquarters are based at Nellis AFB, and missions will be conducted in the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR).
 
Blue forces will execute different specific missions, such as air interdiction, OCA strikes, dynamic targeting, defensive counter air, among others. Targets are defended by a variety of Red force ground and air threats to give participant aircrews a challenging combat training mission.
 
The Red force threats includes other human virtual fighter pilots flying as agressors that try to replicate the tactics and techniques of potential adversaries to Blue forces.

## Course length and start/finish of course.

A flight takes place every two weeks. A normal course can have 3 or 4 students so, the duration of the course is around 8 working weeks.

## Course target audience.

DCSW is a high fidelity air combat simulator that allows for flying combat missions with procedures and tactics very close to real life. Therefore, the course is
 intended for students fully committed to do  the job and with good teamwork skills. This is not a weapon school so all participants, students or not, must have a deep knowledge 
 of the chosen platform. That is, beeing what usually squadrons call Combat Ready or Mission Qualified. In this sense, acceptance priority is for squadrons that
 present at least one student with its corresponding evaluator. Submitted applications for support personel role (ATC/GCI) and/or red pilots will be appreciated.


 Each student will fly as Mission Commander at least in one mission, and will get a grade (Qualified/Not Qualified), at the end of the course. 
 
 Allowable DCSW platforms include F16, F18, F14 and Mirage 2000C. Additionally, a limited number of slots for support personnel are also available including GCI and ATC 

## Course composition.

The optimum composition of a COMAO course is as follows:

#### 18-24  participants:
- 10-12 A-G
- 6-8 A-A
- 2-4 SEAD

#### Support:
- 1 ATC
- 1 GCI
