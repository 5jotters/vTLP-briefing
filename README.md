# vTLP-briefing
Wellcome to the virtual Tactical Leadership Program pages hosted by the spanish squadron [GV5JS](http://foro.gv5js.com/). Virtual TLP offers to the participants the oportunity to fly combat training missions in DCSW. The exercise provides an scenario where the virtual pilot is exposed to the complexities of planning, briefing and executing a composite attack force mission COMAO.

The main objective is to mimic the real TLP to the extend that it is possible inside a simulation, while at the same time having fun and making friends. In short, the vTLP aims for training and development of knowledge and leadership skills, necessary to conduct a multirol air tactical mission.

The programme has been hosted by the GV5Js since 2018 using Falcon BMS. After three successful editions, the vTLP staff has decided to also offer the course in DCSW. In this simulator headquarters will be based in Nellis AFB, Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR).
 
Blue forces will execute different specific missions, such as air interdiction, OCA strikes, dynamic targeting, defensive counter air, among others. Targets are defended by a variety of Red force ground and air threats to give participant aircrews a challenging combat training mission.
 
The Red force threats includes other human virtual fighter pilots flying as agressors that try to replicate the tactics and techniques of potential adversaries to Blue forces.
