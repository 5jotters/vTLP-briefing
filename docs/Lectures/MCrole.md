# Mission Commander responsabilities

Dynamic campaigns, available in Falcon BMS and hopefully in DCSW in the near future, are conducted through a
series of parallel and sequential Composite Air Operations (COMAO). COMAO is the term used when dissimilar types of aircraft interact in coordinated actions to
achieve defined military objectives within a given time and geographical area. It normally involves a large number of aircraft, more than 15 aircrafts with 
between strikers, escort, sead, sweepers...  

Blue doctrine dictates a leadership principle of centralized control and decentralized exection. There is centralized control located at a 
Combined Air Operation Center (CAOC) that has the responsibility and authority for planning, directing and coordinating air capabilities with
a single commander and his staff.  Decentralized execution involves delegating execution authority to sub-commanders, to
make on-scene decisions that exploit opportunities in complex, rapidly changing or fluid situations. The latter leadership role is referred to as
the Mission Commander (MC). The MC is given the task through an air Tasking Order ([ATO](ATO.md)). The ATO describes essential task information
for the COMAO, such as objectives, participating forces, target,
time frame, Rules of Engagement and deconfliction parameters. Even
though the ATO contains a lot of information, it serves only as a broad
set of parameters for the COMAO. Through planning and coordination
