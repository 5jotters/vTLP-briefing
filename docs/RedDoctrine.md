![](../Images/vTLPlogo.png)
## COURSE AND  MISSIONS  OBJECTIVES:

vTLP  course  main  goal  is  to  train  Blue  forces in  advanced  complex  scenarios. This course  is  built  and  planned  in  order  to  make  Mission  Commanders  and  learn  best  tactics  to  fight  against  an  enemy  force  taking  into  account  available  assets  and  resources.

Having  said  this.  Red  team  has  to  focus  in  providing  best  training  to  Blue  forces,  not  being  the  best  pilot  or  team in  the world  killing  as  many  blues  as  possible.

You  will  receive,  3-4  days  prior  to  mission  day,  some  coordination  documents  in  order  to  create your  flights  and  plan  your  tactics.

One  participant  will  be  Red  Team  coordinator  and  will  give  you  all  information  need  to  fly  the  mission  properly.

Normally  Red  team  AOR  will  be  west  of  NTTR  which  include  1  MOBs,  Tonopah  test  and range airbase.

Red  Team  platforms  and  weapons  load  will  be  normally,  F-16C,F-18C,F-14B(NO  PHOENIX  MISSILE)  Aggressor  carrying  AIM-120B  and  AIM  7  or  similar.

Mission  limitations  will  be:

- Red  Caps  will  be  minimum  25  NM  from  FLOT  (Separation line  between  east  and  west map, you will see in the map theatre)

- You are  not allowed  to shoot  any  blue  aircraft  inside  (blue  territory).

- You  do  not  have  BCA  (border  crossing  authority)  that's  mean  you  are  not  allowed  fly  through  Blue  territory.

- You  must  comply  with KILL  REMOVAL  PROCEDURE.

- Your  planning  must  be  in  accordance  with  objective  to  protect  or  attack.  (For  instance,  if you  have  to  protect  one  MOB,  is  not  good  to plan  5  caps  along  of  the  AOR,  concentrate  to  elaborate  best  MOB  defending  tactics).  That's  what  blue  team  is  expecting  from  Red  Forces.

- NEVER  LEAVE  any  fighter  aircraft  flying  with  AI.  If  some  pilots  have  a  problem  and  exit  from  the  aircraft,  leader  has  to command  him  to  land  immediately.

- It  is  very  important  that  you  comply  with  time  on  station  (please  do  not  go  for  AAR  if  you  not  are  able  to  be  at  time  on  your  cap  or  push  point,  otherwise  you  will  degrade  mission  for  Blue and VRF staff will  take this  action  into account  for  next  missions  and  courses.

In  other  worlds:  PLAN  SOMETHING  THAT  MAKES  SENSE  AND  DO  NOT  FORGET  MAIN  COURSE  GOAL!!!!!
